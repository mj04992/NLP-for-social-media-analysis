                "transcript": "[Applause] Moses Atalama is a young boxer already being compared to the legendary Mike Tyson. I love you, Mike. Lightning fast punches, devastating power, and a predatory fury in the ring. He obliterates opponents in just minutes. But the most impressive part, Itama has set his sights on breaking Tyson's record, aiming to become the youngest heavyweight champion in history. Will he succeed? Let's take a closer [Applause] [Music] look. Moses Atama was born on December 28th, 2004 in Slovakia to a Nigerian father and a Slovakian mother. His early life was marked by encounters with racism, prompting his family to move to England in search of better opportunities. Settling in Chattam, Kent, Itama began his boxing journey at a young age, inspired by the legendary Prince Nasim Hamemed. I'd say my ring intelligence. Obviously, I've been boxing since I was nine. So, yeah, I think what separates me from the other boys is my uh my ring intelligence, my ring IQ. Italma's amateur boxing career was nothing short of remarkable. He remained undefeated, winning several gold medals at the European and World Championships. His amateur record stood at 200 with 10 knockouts. some of the footage I managed to get hold of, which he doesn't know about, but you know, they got their headguards on and I didn't realize at first who he was sparring with. When I knew it was, I thought, \"Bloody hell.\" In January 2023, Moses Itama signed with Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions. Just a few weeks later, on January 28th, he made his professional debut in London in the heavyweight division. Itama quickly captured the attention of experts, showcasing his incredible potential. In his debut fight, he knocked out Czech fighter Marcel Bode in just 23 seconds. The fact that his brother's lost tonight, this is the first big test of his professional defeat out, hasn't he? And what a start. What a start. One left punch to the head was enough to send B to the canvas, proving Itama's destructive power. And what a start. What a start. He's a knockout machine as a junior amateur. In his second fight, Itama faced experienced Mexican boxer Rammon Alberto Ibara. However, all of Ibara's skills were no match for Itama's overwhelming power and speed. Here he is tonight looking for another. In the 35th second of the first round, Itama unleashed a brutal combination, finishing with a right hook that sealed the deal. Oh, what a shot. There he goes. In his third professional bout, Itama faced his toughest test yet. the experienced Costantin Dov Bishenko 2025 to be the youngest man to ever do it. Coming back with that straight left hand. After crushing his first two opponents in just 58 seconds, Itama was now in a situation where he had to go the distance in there for Champion Richie. And we've got to remember there's a good shot left hand. Despite Dav Bishchenko's 12 career losses, he was known for his endurance and had never been knocked out, making him the ideal opponent to challenge Atama's ability to go rounds. Pichenko getting a little bit more ambitious. This fight was a true test for the 18-year-old Itama, who continued to showcase his incredible power and technique, delivering powerful blows to both the head and body of his opponent on that back foot there. However, Dav Bishenko displayed remarkable resilience, absorbing all of Itama's hits and demonstrating surprising stamina and determination tonight, haven't we? a shot there. Yeah, just made him screw up his legs against two men who came in to roll over. Dog Bishenko wanted to stand there and take it. My job is get into the ring and frighten whoever they put in front of me. Even if they're so glad tomorrow fighting King Kong, I'll be no problem. Despite not securing an early victory, Itama demonstrated not only his physical attributes, but also his ability to adapt to challenging situations, which made this fight a valuable experience for his professional development. In his fourth fight, Moses Atama faced Argentine boxer Kevin Nicholas Espendola on July 29th, 2023. Future now, it's almost like he needs to get he needs to get angry in [Applause] there from the bombs that you know he really does. Despite a short three-month break, Itama entered the ring with the confidence that he would continue his unbeaten streak. He goes step back and create a little bit distance and landed a good job who's trying his best to keep the distance. Espendola with his more experienced fighting style posed a challenge for Itama appreciation to win if they're trying not to get stopped. Oh, he made a hier. However, the young fighter displayed impressive strength and control in the ring, not allowing the Argentine to dictate the pace of the fight like this. Although Espendola endured the relentless pressure and made things difficult for Itama at times, the young Brit showed his readiness for tougher opponents by managing the fight and responding to every challenge. Going to be very bruised in the morning. And that was a great left hook. Moves it to the body again. Comes in with a big right hand. Now he switches to the body again. Can he finish it? No, it's too late. In the end, Itama secured the victory by decision, improving his professional record to 40-0. 3-1 Super Heavy Youth Championship. Looking for big punches. Would love to be the youngest ever body also, but they're that in his next fight, Moses Atama faced the ambitious Amin Busetta on September 23rd, 2023. in there tonight and looking for a punch to detect and set who was born in Morocco but these days from the very first seconds of the bout Itama took control applying immense pressure on his opponent this year left uppercut found himself in deep trouble in the first round getting knocked down twice by's precise punches who's looking for the finish still 90 seconds in the round to go and in goes the tower after the second knockdown the referee decided to stop the fight. This victory restored his signature style, knockouts, marking his third in his career and improved his record to 5-0. Obviously, as an amateur, I won two national titles, three European medals, uh, gold medals, and a world title. And as an as a professional, I'm looking to replicate that and doing it quicker than the youngest heavyweight world champion himself, Mike Tyson. I see him sitting at the front. He's he's staring at me. But um listen, pressure makes diamonds, man. Pressure makes diamonds. Mike Son just called out, \"I love you, man.\" How does that feel? I love you, Mike. In his sixth fight, Moses Itama faced the experienced Hungarian boxer Istvan Bernat on October 28th, 2023. For Bernat, 34 years old, this was his fight after a long hiatus, and his record stood at 10-1 with a 72% knockout rate. in the next two after that set out in the last one and obviously albeit against the fight began in Itama's usual aggressive manner and his punches proved too powerful for Bernat. Decent record indeed. So 16 years older looking downstairs already in the first round. The Hungarian was knocked down after a series of powerful strikes from Atalma. Business here doesn't need to tell me he started quickly. Oh, good shot. Moses didn't give him any time to recover. Continuing his fierce attack after a brutal uppercut and right hook which rocked Bernat to his core. His position became critical. The referee seeing that Bernat was unable to continue decided to stop the fight. Brilliant electric star. Brilliant of the right hook as well. Bernard all over the sixth victory and fourth knockout. Moses Sitama continues to amaze with his power and technique adding another impressive win to his record. In his final fight of 2023, Moses Itama demonstrated astonishing power and skill against Polish boxer Misha Bolos. Moses and his team don't spend too long worrying about the opponent. As usual, Itama started the fight with an aggressive attack, instantly seizing control. His style, reminiscent of a young Mike Tyson, once again lived up to expectations. He left no chance for his opponent and destroyed Bolas in just one minute. Bol after he's gone. The first knockdown came from a precise powerful hook that sent Bolas staggering to the canvas. Despite getting up and continuing, it was clear that his resistance had been broken. The next combination of punches sent Bolas down again and the referee stopped the fight. In a straight line, inviting the trouble. He's brave, but he's completely outdone. In 2024, Moses Atama continued his impressive winning streak, knocking out Dan Garber in the first round. Seven wins from seven fights tournament and the distance twice in very late. From the very first seconds, Itama took control, unleashing a series of powerful punches on his opponent like lightning. Under the barrage of attacks, Garber was literally driven around the ring, forced to retreat from corner to corner. fight on Monday. It's the third play to him. His hands are getting quicker. He's got destructive for that big left hand to left hand counter as Ga comes forward fast short. After Atama delivered another lightning fast combination, the referee had no doubt and stopped the fight declaring a technical knockout in the first round. The referee's having a look. I'll be very shocked if he's not at least the heavyweight world champion, if not as said unified and maybe undiscu. On May 18th, 2024, Moses Italma continued his rapid rise in boxing, undercarding the super fight between Alexander Usyk and Tyson Fury, facing the experienced German Ilia Mezenev. Looking ahead, it's worth noting that Moses Atalama sparred twice with Tyson Fury as part of Fury's preparation for both fights against Alexander Usyk. According to Fury himself, the young heavyweight left a strong impression. He's not just a guy with power, he's got the mind of a fighter. Fury also remarked, \"I think he's a good kid.\" Um I've said I've said in the past that I think he can be a champion and I do think just like I said with um Jared Anderson. I think Jared and Moses are very very both good fighters. Um however, there's a lot of um temptation. Moreover, Itama was one of the few fighters to feature on the undercard of both Usyak Fury mega events, which further underlines his rapidly rising status in the world of professional boxing. The fight against Ilia Mazangev marked Atalma's first title bout with the vacant WBO Intercontinental Heavyweight belt on the line. Shut everyone up if he can come out here. Oh, that's going to be the right hand over the top. It's not just the hand speed, it's the foot speed. From the outset, Itama displayed his dominance, actively controlling the pace of the fight. Hook hook upstairs. In the first round, he caught me on a counterattack with a powerful hook which caused the German to lose his balance for a moment. Oh, massive left hand and sends him back into the corner. Eats a right and another left. He's trying to hold on but not letting him. In the second round with a powerful combination, Itama sent Mainev into a full knockdown. [Music] Though Mezenev got up, the referee assessing his condition decided to stop the fight. This victory not only added another convincing win to Itama's record, but also earned him the WBO Intercontinental Heavyweight title, solidifying his reputation as one of the most promising and dangerous heavyweights on the world stage. On July 27th, 2024, Moses Itama successfully defended his WBO Intercontinental title, facing the experienced Polish boxer Mario in a bout held at the O2 Arena in London as part of the Joe Joyce versus Derek Chisora event. Despite Walk's age, 44 years, his physical advantages, weight, height, and experience were not enough to stop the 19-year-old Itama, who took the initiative from the very first round. I'll be able to take a ball. Vladimir Klitschko. In the second round, Itama went all in, launching a flurry of vicious punches that left Wak in a helpless state. I think it's a steam. Yeah, it was only any major risk, but again, the speed being with a minute remaining in the second round, Walk was sent to the canvas after taking a series of powerful punches. Hurry, I want a stepbystep approach, he said. And that was a little open. Mario tried to recover, but Italma didn't let up, cornering him and continuing his destructive attack. There's been the look of genuine fear in the eyes of since the start of this fight and he cannot fend his man off and the refere is going to stop him and rightly so. That was taken. On December 21st, 2024 in Riyad, Saudi Arabia, as part of the Grand Alexander Usyk versus Tyson Fury 2 event, Moses Atalama delivered yet another knockout spectacle, facing the seasoned Australian Demsi McKeen. As he landed his punches, he began to break down McKeen's defense until the moment came for a powerful overhand. The punch stunned the Australian, sending him to the canvas. Shaken, McKeen tried to recover, but Atama didn't give him a break, immediately following up with a left hook. This time, McKeen's corner decided to intervene, stopping the fight and declaring a technical knockout in the first round. With every fight, Moses Atama continues to assert himself as one of the most promising and dangerous heavyweights in boxing. His 11 and0 9 ko's record confirms that he's not just another young talent, but a true force ready to leave his mark in boxing history. Moreover, Itama has set his sights on a grand goal to break Mike Tyson's record and become the youngest heavyweight champion in history. Inspired by Tyson's success who became the youngest world champion at 20, Itama aims to rewrite history and achieve greatness at an even younger age. His relentless drive, confidence in his abilities, and the powerful style he demonstrates in each fight suggests that this young boxer is capable of achieving incredible things. With every knockout and every victory, Itama is getting closer to his goal. His ambitions certainly promise an exciting and extraordinary career. He doesn't just want to be a champion. He strives to be the best in his field and rewrite boxing history. What do you think, fans? Could Itama be the new Tyson? Will he break Tyson's record and become the youngest heavyweight champion?

You&#39;re such a baby/snowflake.&quot; (I took out all of the cuss words he&#39;d use lol) When he&#39;d punch holes in the wall directly next to my head, throw me into the wall knocking the air out of me, use me &amp; my siblings as bb gun target practice at the age of 5 and younger, throwing shoes at my brothers head when he was 1, threatening to fist fight my 15 year old brother, and threw a full coke can at his head (my dad got mad when my brother didn&#39;t flinch &amp; it got worse) and so much more, it was all &quot;jokes&quot; &amp; I was always the one who &quot;couldnt take a joke&quot;<br><br>When I ran away from home at 18 he told everyone it was for no reason &amp; i was just trying to hurt him &amp; when he stole my phone &amp; wallet out of my moms car I had to freeze the cards and wipe my phone bc he was trying to find me &amp; my fiances location to hurt us (bc im white &amp; my fiance is \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd &amp; my dad is extremely racist) he burnt all my photos of me &amp; my fiances first anniversary that he found in my wallet when he stole it. I&#39;ll never get those back, and I&#39;m sure all of that was a &quot;joke&quot; too.<br>Also, in case yall were wondering, the police did nothing. &quot;Lack of physical evidence&quot; or wtv.",
